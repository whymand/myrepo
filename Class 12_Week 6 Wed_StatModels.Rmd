Decision Trees
- like a linear reg, but better for categorical variables!
- "non-robust" - result vulnerable to changes in a few observations in og dataw

Random Forest 
- Aggregation of many trees built using the same underlying data
- bootstrap!!! sampling from your data w/ replacement *resampling*
   - treat og data as population.. reqs. no assumptions about distribution
